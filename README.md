PHP Parser
==========

This is a PHP 5.4 (and older) parser written in PHP. It's purpose is to simplify static code analysis and
manipulation.

Documentation can be found in the [`doc/`][1] directory.

***Note: This project is experimental, so the API is subject to change.***

In a Nutshell
-------------

Basically, the parser does nothing more than turn some PHP code into an abstract syntax tree. ("nothing
more" is kind of sarcastic here as PHP has a ... uhm, let's just say "not nice" ... grammar, which makes
parsing PHP very hard.)

For example, if you stick this code in the parser:

```php
<?php
echo 'Hi', 'World';
hello\world('foo', 'bar' . 'baz');
```

You'll get a syntax tree looking roughly like this:

```
array(
		0: Stmt_Echo(
				exprs: array(
						0: Scalar_String(
								value: Hi
						)
						1: Scalar_String(
								value: World
						)
				)
		)
		1: Expr_FuncCall(
				name: Name(
						parts: array(
								0: hello
								1: world
						)
				)
				args: array(
						0: Arg(
								value: Scalar_String(
										value: foo
								)
								byRef: false
						)
						1: Arg(
								value: Expr_Concat(
										left: Scalar_String(
												value: bar
										)
										right: Scalar_String(
												value: baz
										)
								)
								byRef: false
						)
				)
		)
)
```

You can then work with this syntax tree, for example to statically analyze the code (e.g. to find
programming errors or security issues).

Additionally, you can convert a syntax tree back to PHP code. This allows you to do code preprocessing
(like automatedly porting code to older PHP versions).

So, that's it, in a nutshell. You can find everything else in the [docs][1].
